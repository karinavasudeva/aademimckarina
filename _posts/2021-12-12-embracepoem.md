Embrace
------


When I was a child,\
  my grandmother took me to the beach;\
    where the ocean gently beckoned me,\
      with its comforting outreach.

As I timorously slipped my toes in water,\
   small waves caressed them for the very first time;\
    tenderly reassuring me not dread what lay beyond,\
      that everything would be fine.

Still, I wasn’t quite convinced,\
   not sure of the distant rumble I could hear;\
    anxious and insecure, I burst into tears,\
      clinging furiously to my grandmother in fear.

Like me, my uncle found an unexplainable solace at the beach,\
  like me, he too had feared what lay beyond,\
    But the distant rumbled captivated him\
      It was a welcome change from reality, where he was despond 

The last time I stood on that shore,\
  my uncle had already taken his life;\
    and as we gently immersed his ashes in the ocean,\
      anger in my heart was rife.

I had so many questions for the sea;\
  even more than the grains of sand beneath my feet;\
    why wouldn’t it talk to me? could it not feel my heartache?\
      how long would it then continue to ignore my entreat?

Why did it become so suffocating for him?\
  why did he give up on life?\
    could the ocean feel his unbearable pain,\
      and mercifully ended his tempestuous strife?

What must have gone through your heart,\
  tell me, O’ mighty sea;\
    was it out of pity that you took him away,\
      so you could set his soul free?

Then one night a voice consoled me in a dream,\
that he was now in a peaceful place;\
finding refuge and solace in tranquil depths,\
liberated in the ocean’s comforting embrace.
