### Policy Brief: An Inquiry Into an N.C. Department of Housing & Community Development and New Legislative Approaches
As a Government Research Fellow for the NC Office of Recovery & Resiliency (NCORR), I spent last summer collaborating with a team of 4 students on an independently-directed research project evaluating whether North Carolina needs a Department of Housing. We conducted 29 qualitative interviews with housing stakeholders and local government officials to identify needs and whitespaces and then crafted recommendations for Gov. Cooper's office regarding future housing policies. I became more aware of the impacts policy can have especially in a public health crisis like Covid-19.

### Menstrual Cup Patent 
---
I invented and self prosecuted the patent application for a backflow and leakage-preventing menstrual cup for collecting menstrual discharge. The menstrual cup has a safety feature that prevents the backflow of menstrual blood back into the vagina and uterus, which minimizes contact with the collected menstrual blood and prevents the risk of infection and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) to the user. This safety feature also stops accidental leakage during use and prevents spillage of menstrual blood when the cup is removed by the user. The cup is designed to be easily and quickly emptied.
