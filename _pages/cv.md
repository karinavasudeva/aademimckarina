### Projects ###
---
**Backflow preventing menstrual cup — US Patent #10470920B1**
Invented a backflow and leakage-preventing menstrual cup for collecting menstrual discharge. The menstrual cup has a safety feature that prevents the backflow of menstrual blood back into the vagina and uterus, which minimizes contact with the collected menstrual blood and prevents the risk of infection and toxic shock syndrome (TSS) to the user. This safety feature also stops accidental leakage during use and prevents spillage of menstrual blood when the cup is removed by the user. The cup is designed to be easily and quickly emptied. Self prosecuted the patent application.

**Dye-based photovoltaic cell experiment**
Created a dye-based photovoltaic cell using blackberries to develop an inexpensive solar cell to explore sustainable energy solutions for regions lacking effective energy sources.
