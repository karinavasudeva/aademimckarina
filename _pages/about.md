I am a second-year Morehead-Cain scholar at UNC Chapel Hill dedicated to community service and devising sustainable, creative solutions for real-world problems that afflict our community. I am currently pursuing a B.A. in English & Comparative Literature and (hopefully) a B.S.P.H. at the Gillings School of Public Health.
