Karina Vasudeva is a second-year Morehead-Cain scholar at UNC Chapel Hill dedicated to community service and devising sustainable, creative solutions for real-world problems that afflict our community. Karina is currently pursuing a B.A. in English & Comparative Literature and (hopefully) a B.S.P.H. in Health Policy & Management at the Gillings School of Public Health. She is independently studying epigenetics and immunology. 

Her public health research interests include health policy, effective use of resources in global health contexts, menstrual hygiene, and water sanitation & hygiene. Driven largely due to her own experience with Crohn's Disease, she is also excited to explore the gut microbiome and epigenetic regulations of inflammatory bowel disease in [Dr. Sheikh's Lab](https://sheikhlab.web.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill. 

Karina is a self-proclaimed bookworm, activist, and inventor.
